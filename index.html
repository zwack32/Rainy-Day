        <h1> Rainy Day </h1>
        <p>At Rainy Day, we are devoted to making you have the time of your life... that is, the worst time of your life. We can be hired to enforce a bad day upon one of your enemies, or a bad day as a fun prank on your friends! We have 50% off on orders from March 15th--April 1st. We also have 25% off on orders from December 1st--December 25. Your enemies will have a bad time! Birds are singing! Not your enemies; they're fleeing in terror.</p>
